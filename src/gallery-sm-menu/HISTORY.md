SmugMug Menu History
====================

## git

* Now using `Y.Tree` from YUI core, which means Menu requires YUI 3.9.0+.

* Y.Menu.Item's `isDisabled()` and `isHidden()` methods now return `true` if any
  ancestor of the item is disabled or hidden, respectively.

* Fixed: Menus take up space even when they're hidden. [#8]

## 2012-02-07

* Initial release.
